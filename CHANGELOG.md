# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Android VPN startup**: wait up to five seconds with capped backoff for the
  tun2socks control socket before handing off the VPN file descriptor. Failed
  handoff now closes retry sockets and stops the VPN instead of leaving a
  connected-looking tunnel without traffic.

## [3.4.0]

### Added
- **Hysteria**: URL parser and support for Hysteria protocol in V2Ray

### Fixed
- **XHTTP**: Fixed `allowInsecure` handling on xhttp parser

## [3.3.0]

### Changed
- **Core**: Updated embedded Xray core to **v26.6.1** (from v26.4.17)
- **Android**: Updated `libv2ray` (AAR) and `V2rayCoreManager` to match the new core

## [3.2.0]

This release updates the embedded **Xray core to v26.4.17** and refreshes the Android `libv2ray` AAR and `V2rayCoreManager` integration. The items below follow upstream Xray changes since the **v25.10.15** line.

### Core — architecture
- **TUN inbound (Android VPN mode)**: Native integration with `VpnService`, with full-device VPN via a TUN interface, reducing the need for tun2socks in many deployments.
- **Process-based routing**: Route traffic by application or process where Android allows it, for finer control in VPN scenarios.

### Core — protocols & networking
- **Hysteria2**: High-throughput, UDP-based transport with better performance on unstable mobile links.
- **UDPhop**: Dynamic UDP port hopping to keep sessions working when ports are filtered or throttled.
- **Salamander obfuscation layer**: Optional traffic obfuscation to reduce visibility to mobile DPI.

### Core — obfuscation (FinalMask)
- Custom HTTP/TCP headers, TCP fragmentation, and UDP noise; randomized traffic patterns to resist fingerprinting and DPI.

### Core — security
- Replaces the old insecure TLS option with **certificate pinning** via `pinnedPeerCertSha256`.
- **REALITY**: Tighter handling of invalid or intercepted certificates, with stronger MITM protection on untrusted and mobile networks.

### Core — DNS & routing
- **XDNS**: More stable mobile DNS; routing behavior aligned with TUN mode; fewer surprises when the device switches between WiFi and mobile data.

### Core — performance & stability (mobile)
- Lower memory use (improved geodata handling); fewer Android runtime crash paths; more stable performance on poor networks; more reliable long-lived background sessions.

### Android — TUN
- Stabler TUN path through the VPN `Service` stack; less packet loss on high-latency links; better behavior under background execution limits; fewer stalls and race conditions in typical mobile conditions.

### Changed
- **Android**: Updated `libv2ray` (AAR) and `V2rayCoreManager` to use the new core and APIs above.
